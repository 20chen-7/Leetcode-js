# LCA
## Idea
- classification discussion
    - find p or q in recursion, return p or q
    - find Left leaf, right leaf, return current node
    - find Left tree, LCA in left
    - find Right tree, LCA in right
    - no left or right, return null
## List
- [LC235](https://leetcode.cn/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-search-tree/)
- [LC236](https://leetcode.cn/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-tree/)

# BST

# Binary Tree Depth
## Sub Probem
- left leaf
- right leaf
- whole depth = max(left max, right max)+1
